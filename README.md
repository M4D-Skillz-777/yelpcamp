# YelpCamp

Capstone project in my Web Dev Bootcamp 2021 by Colt Steele.

## Description

This project was a the final big project from the course. With this i learnt how to you node librarys, crud functionalty, Password/login and much more.
I encounterd a lot problems and code breaks along the way but I had fun doing it.

P.S this will also be my first git push so also kinda proud of that
